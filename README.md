## Dear colleague's

To whomsoever is reading this. 

Greetings, I'm Mason, a 'Computer Scientist' who happens to be interested in many computational fields: 
cybersecurity, cryptography, embedded, freelance, full stack, machine learning, networking, and other... 
related tasks. I also enjoy digging around at the hardware level as well as machine level, and always...
working within my own limts/boundaries. 

Outside of the computer world. I enjoy playing several musical instruments, such as: acoustic guitar...
bass, drums, electric guitar, and piano. Then there is reading books based on: complex mathematics...
data structures and algorithms, poetry, or things that peak genuine interest.
